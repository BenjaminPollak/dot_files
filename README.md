# My Dotfiles

This repo is for tracking my dotfiles. It currently contains the following:

* Ansible Scripts (for quickly installing and configuring software on a new computer)
* Bash Config Scripts
* Git Configs
* Vim Config

These are the files that need to be added:
* ~/.config/i3/config
* ~/.config/i3blocks/
* ~/.config/nvim/
