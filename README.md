# My Dotfiles

This repo is for tracking my dotfiles. It currently contains the following:

* Ansible Scripts (for quickly installing and configuring software on a new computer)
* Bash Config Scripts
* Git Configs
* Vim/Nvim Config

Config files are managed through GNU Stow.

Dockerfile and Makefile are included so I can test this setup easily.

# TODOs
* Add ~/.config/i3/config
* Add ~/.config/i3blocks/
* Refactor custom nvim commands to use Lua instead of Vimscript
